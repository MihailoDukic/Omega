## Project Description

Omega is a fictional agency that creates modern websites for various businesses around the world. The website consists of a modern design with a simplistic approach to animations.

## The Process 
The website consists of 5 pages that are fully responsive on major devices and across major browsers. I used desktop-first approach when creating the website . I usually start of with mobile-first but for this design I decided desktop would work best then just use breakpoints on different viewports.


## Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, Javascript, GSAP, Glide slider , Parcel bundler
